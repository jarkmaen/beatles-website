# fab.two - Beatles Website

## Overview

A full stack web application for sharing a systematic ranking of every Beatles song. My friend and I rated every track based on multiple categories (like instrumentation, vocals and lyrics) to create an objective as possible ranking of their entire discography. Our ranking data and a write up for each song can be found on the site. The home page also has a daily changing "Beatles Song of the Day" feature. Link to the live website coming soon...
